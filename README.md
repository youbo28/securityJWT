# Security Setup Overview

This section describes the steps taken to implement a secure and scalable authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

---

## 1. Create User and Role Entities

- Defined the `UserDetails` entity representing application users.
- Created a `Role` entity to manage user roles and permissions.
- Established a relationship between `UserDetails` and `Role`.

âœ… Focused on a flexible, extendable design to support future growth.

---

## 2. Create Repositories

- Built `UserDetailsRepository` for user entity operations.
- Built `RoleRepository` for role entity operations.
- Used Spring Data JPA for simplified CRUD operations.

âœ… Simplified data access and management for authentication.

---

## 3. Create User Service

- Implemented a `UserDetailsService` for user-specific business logic.
- Integrated it with Spring Security's authentication process.
- Managed user registration, retrieval, and security interactions.

âœ… Achieved clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

---

## 4. Add JJWT Dependencies

- Added the JJWT library to handle JWT creation, signing, and validation.

âœ… Prepared the environment for secure token operations.

---

## 5. Create JWT Authentication Filter

- Implemented a custom `JWTAuthenticationFilter` extending `OncePerRequestFilter`.
- Responsibilities:
  - Intercept each HTTP request.
  - Extract JWT token from headers.
  - Validate the token and authenticate the user.
  - Populate Spring Security context if valid.

âœ… Centralized token validation logic.

---

## 6. Configure Security Filter Chain

- Created a `SecurityFilterChain` bean to define security policies.
- Added the JWT authentication filter before the username-password authentication filter.
- Enabled stateless session management for a true RESTful API.

âœ… Customized authentication flow and secured endpoints.

---

## 7. Provide Authentication Provider

- Created an `AuthenticationProvider` bean using `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.
- Linked it with the custom `UserDetailsService` and a password encoder.

âœ… Enabled user authentication against the database securely.

---

## 8. Provide Password Encoder

- Provided a `PasswordEncoder` bean using BCrypt algorithm.

âœ… Ensured strong password encryption and protection.

---

## 9. Provide Authentication Manager

- Provided an `AuthenticationManager` bean for manual authentication support.

âœ… Enabled custom login flows with Spring Security.

---

## 10. Create JWT Service

- Developed a `JWTService` with the following responsibilities:
  - Generate secure, signed JWT tokens for authenticated users.
  - Validate JWT tokens, including expiration and signature.
  - Extract claims like username and roles from the token.

âœ… Centralized all JWT-related operations for clean architecture and easier maintenance.

---

## 11. Create Authentication Endpoints

- Created a **register** endpoint at `/api/v1/auth/register`:
  - Allows new users to register and receive a JWT token immediately after registration.
- Created an **authenticate** endpoint at `/api/v1/auth/authenticate`:
  - Allows existing users to log in and receive a fresh JWT token.

âœ… Provided a simple and secure user onboarding and login experience.

---

## 12. Create Secured Test Endpoint

- Created a secured test controller at `/api/v1/demo-controller`.
- Accessible only with a valid JWT token.
- Used to verify that authentication and authorization are correctly applied.

âœ… Confirmed that the security setup works correctly and only authenticated users can access protected resources.

A massive **thank you** and **huge shoutout** to [**Bouali**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVdQ3iuovg0&pp=ygUWYm91YWxpIHNwcmluZyBzZWN1cml0edIHCQmECQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D) for his excellent Spring Security tutorial! ðŸŽ¥ðŸ”¥

> His clear explanations, hands-on examples, and structured approach were incredibly helpful in guiding the implementation of this secure authentication system.

âœ… Highly recommend checking out his work if you're building security with Spring Boot and JWT!
